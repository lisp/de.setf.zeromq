	The concept of the
	
	<a href="license.html">
	  GNU Lesser General Public License version 2.1
	</a>
	
	("<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>")
	has been adopted to govern the use and distribution of
	above-mentioned application. However, the 
	
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>

	uses terminology that is more appropriate for a program
	written in C than one written in Lisp.  Nevertheless, the 

	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	
	can still be applied to a Lisp program if certain
	clarifications are made.  This document details those
	clarifications. Accordingly, the license for the open-source Lisp
	applications consists of this document plus the 

	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.

	Wherever there is a conflict between this document and
	the <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>, this document takes
	precedence over the <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
	A "Library" in Lisp is a collection of Lisp functions, data and
	foreign modules. The form of the Library can be Lisp source code (for
	processing by an interpreter) or object code (usually the result of
	compilation of source code or built with some other
	mechanisms). Foreign modules are object code in a form that can be
	linked into a Lisp executable. When we speak of functions we do so in
	the most general way to include, in addition, methods and unnamed
	functions. Lisp "data" is also a general term that includes the data
	structures resulting from defining Lisp classes. A Lisp application
	may include the same set of Lisp objects as does a Library, but this
	does not mean that the application is necessarily a "work based on the
	Library" it contains.
      </p>
      <p>
	The Library consists of everything in the distribution file set before
	any modifications are made to the files. If any of the functions or
	classes in the Library are redefined in other files, then those
	redefinitions ARE considered a work based on the Library. If
	additional methods are added to generic functions in the Library,
	those additional methods are NOT considered a work based on the
	Library. If Library classes are subclassed, these subclasses are NOT
	considered a work based on the Library. If the  Library is modified to
	explicitly call other functions that are neither part of Lisp itself
	nor an available add-on module to Lisp, then the functions called by
	the modified Library ARE considered a work based on the  Library. The
	goal is to ensure that the Library will compile and run without
	getting undefined function errors.
      </p>
      <p>
	It is permitted to add proprietary source code to the Library, but it
	must be done in a way such that the Library will still run without
	that proprietary code present. Section 5 of the
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	distinguishes
	between the case of a library being dynamically linked at runtime and
	one being statically linked at build time.
	Section 5 of the
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	states that the former results in an executable that is a "work that
	uses the Library."
	Section 5 of the
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	states that the latter
	results in one that is a "derivative of the Library", which is
	therefore covered by
	the <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.
	Since Lisp only offers one choice, which is
	to link the Library into an executable at build time, we declare that,
	for the purpose applying
	the <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	to the Library,
	an executable that results from linking a "work that uses the Library"
	with the Library
	is considered a "work that uses the Library" and is therefore NOT
	covered by the <a href="license.html">LGPL</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
	Because of this declaration,
	section 6 of
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>
	is not applicable to
	the Library.
	However, in connection with each distribution of this
	executable, you must also deliver, in accordance with the terms and
	conditions of the
	<a href="license.html">LGPL</a>,
	the source code of Library (or your derivative thereof)
	that is incorporated into this executable.
